## Hierarchical matrix construction in Rust

Personal project building kernel independent H-matrices with some linalg methods to go along with them. The aim is purely learning some computational maths, get some hands on experience with Rust, and have a bit of fun.

I'm afraid if you actually need something like this that works you may have to wander over to the mscroggs or bempp accounts.
