Personal project where I want to explore Hierarchical matrices and Calderon preconditioning. It's also a fantastic chance to get into the nitty gritty of Rust. If you unfortunately actually need a tool like this with docs and that works, then I'd suggest wandering over to the mscroggs account.

The main aim is to create a fast, kernel independent (although start with Helmholtz and Laplace) hierarchical matrix constructor with some linalg methods (LU, svg, ...) to go with it (+ explore C interface to look into calling in BEM project). All while having a spot of fun.
